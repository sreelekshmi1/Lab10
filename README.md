# Lab10

The Ontario public library dataset has a high potential for data analysis, and it is suitable for the machine learning applications. The dataset contains the details of all type of libraries in Ontario and the number of active library cards, library usage, resources, services, and the details of library working hours.
With the dataset, we can find the usage patterns of libraries, resource allocations for libraries and using the machine learning techniques we can find the impact of their services and programs.

Please open the Assignment10.ipynp for finding the project code. Place the csv file in the same folder as .ipynp file for running the script.
